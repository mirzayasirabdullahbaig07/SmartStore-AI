# 🛒 SmartStore AI – Intelligent Retail Shelf Monitoring Simulation

SmartStore AI is an AI-powered retail shelf monitoring and automated restocking simulation system.  
It simulates how smart retail stores can detect empty shelves, prioritize restocking based on traffic, and automate operational decisions using AI logic.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Retail stores frequently face **out-of-stock situations**, leading to:

- Lost sales opportunities
- Poor customer experience
- Inefficient manual monitoring
- Delayed restocking

Traditional shelf monitoring requires human supervision, which is inefficient and error-prone.

SmartStore AI solves this problem by simulating an intelligent system that:

- Detects empty shelves in real time
- Tracks traffic intensity
- Prioritizes restocking tasks
- Automates robot-based restocking decisions
- Logs operational activity dynamically

## 🚀 Features

- 📦 Real-time shelf status monitoring (Full / Empty)
- 📊 Traffic level tracking (High / Medium / Low)
- ⏱️ Empty duration tracking (minutes)
- 🤖 Automated robot restocking simulation
- 📝 Live action logging
- 📈 Performance metrics dashboard
- ⏲️ Adjustable simulation interval control

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Shelves are continuously monitored.
2. When a shelf becomes empty, the system detects it.
3. AI logic evaluates:
   - Traffic priority
   - Empty duration
4. A restocking task is generated.
5. The robot moves:
   - Dock → Shelf → Restock → Return
6. Metrics and logs update in real time.
